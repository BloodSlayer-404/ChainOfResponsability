### Introduction:
This is an example of the behavioral design pattern called "Chain Of Responsability" for an app that helps you learn about design patterns, you can find that app [here](https://github.com/JoseMartinez117/AppPatrones "here").

#### About: 
This example is based in the way in which some AI in the Pokemon games combats against the player, changing the Porkemon that they have in combat, to another one who teorically can resist the attacks of your Pokemon.

The chain of responsability is conformed by the Pokemon i the team, each Pokemon could handle a type of attack (the type that they resist). In the combat, if a Pokemon dont handle a type of attack, it lets the attack be handled by the other pokemons in the chain.

#### Documentation: 
The documentation of the methods and classes created for the example is in the [Javadoc](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/ChainOfResponsability/tree/master/JavaDoc "Javadoc") folder. 

You can check the coverage of the unitary test created for this proyect in the [htmlReport](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/ChainOfResponsability/tree/master/htmlReport "htmlReport") folder, you can create more test for your own methods.
